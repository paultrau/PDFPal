WELCOME TO PDF PAL

PDF Pal allows you to concatenate multiple PDFs together that share a similar format.

PDF Pal will group together PDFs of the same agent when filenames are properly formated in the following way with underscores (important)

	X_Y_Z_N

Where:

	X = 7 Digit Agent Code
	Y = Last Name 
	Z = First Name
	N = File identifier

Examples:

	1010101_Joe_Blue_2020_Cover
	1010101_Joe_Blue_2020_Final_Data
	1010101_Joe_Blue_2020_Farewell

PDF Data should be held inside the "samples" folder located in the software folder. They should also be sorted alphabetically
