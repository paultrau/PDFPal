WELCOME TO PDF PAL

PDF Pal allows you to concatenate multiple PDFs together that share a similar format.

PDF Pal will group together PDFs of the same agent when filenames are properly formated in the following way with underscores (important)

	X_Y_Z_N

Where:

	X = 7 Digit Agent Code
	Y = Last Name 
	Z = First Name
	N = File identifier

Examples:

	1010101_Joe_Blue_2020_The_Cover
	1010101_Joe_Blue_2020_Final_Data
	1010101_Joe_Blue_2020_Farewell

PDF Data can be held inside the "samples" folder located in the software folder. They should also be sorted alphabetically
	When the user hits "Browse" they are prompted to find the finder where the PDFs are held
	This folder should ONLY hold PDFs to avoid confusion/bugs!

The user is responsible for entering in the PDFs in the order they wish to have them appended.

Using the past 3 examples:
	"The_Cover" will appear last in Mr. Blue's list due to alpha ordering.
	The user enters "The_Cover" (Without quotes) into the field that reads "FIRST", to ensure it goes first.
	Then "Final_Data" in the field that reads "SECOND"
	Then "Farewell" in the field that reads "THIRD"


In the case where only certain agents have a fourth PDF or may only have 2 PDF, enter the MOST COMPLEX order possible, meaning the order with the most PDFs
The program will automatically adjust for any combination.
	Ex. Enter up to the field that reads "FOURTH" even when only a small percentage have the fourth PDF.
			Do not worry if the fourth PDF is not located at the end, even if it the first PDF, it will still work!
			
	
The user is also responsible for entering the desired name of the final output PDF
	Ex. "Final_Combined_Report"

Only after all data is entered can the user click submit, which then prompts the user to located the folder they wish to export the final PDFs into
	If all is set up properly, the PDFs will append correctly.
